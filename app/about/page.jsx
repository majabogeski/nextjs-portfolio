            <h3>Why I coach?</h3>
          <p>Coaching is my calling, born from my deeply personal voyage through life&apos;s trialsâ€”enduring periods of excruciating pain, wrestling with overwhelming anxiety, feeling lost and confused in a sea of uncertainty, grappling with debilitating low self-esteem, and constantly burdened by relentless self-doubt. In moments of crisis, I had a profound awakening, sparking my transition from agony to liberation.</p>
          <p>Diving into meditation, breathwork, somatic practices, and various therapies, along with yoga, life coaching, spiritual guidance, reading self-help and spiritual books, and continuously attending workshops... I experienced a profound transformation. Now, I navigate life&apos;s challenges and uncertainties with calm resilience, equipped with a diverse range of tools. I&apos;ve uncovered my true potential and am living a fulfilling life aligned with my deepest values.</p>
          <p>Now, I&apos;m driven by a deep desire to empower others. My goal is to make a meaningful impact, helping individuals overcome obstacles, tap into their inner strength, and create lasting positive change. Each coaching session is a chance for me to inspire, uplift, and guide others towards greater happiness and fulfillment.</p>
